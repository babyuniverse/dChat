# dChat
This is a *decentralized*, *peer to peer*, *chatting application*, that is using ***GunDB*** and is powered by ***Moralis.io***!

The frontend of this web application is built using ***React JS*** and the backend is built using ***Node***.

User can Login(or Sign Up) using their [***MetaMask wallet***](https://metamask.io/) and for implementing Metamask Login compatibility in my application, I have used [***Moralis.io***](https://moralis.io/).
